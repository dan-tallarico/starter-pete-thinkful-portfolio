# starter-pete-thinkful-portfolio
This project is for the Thinkful Front End Web Dev course. In this lesson I was tasked with updating the stylings on the page using CSS. For the most part, this was accomplished by creating new classes that take advantage of the Flex class. 

You'll see that the content is equally spaced in rows, providing a really nice portfolio for Pete.
